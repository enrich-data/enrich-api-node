# graphmob-api-node

The Graphmob API NodeJS wrapper. Enrich, Search and Verify data from your NodeJS services.

Copyright 2017 Graphmob. See LICENSE for copying information.

* **üìù Implements**: [Graphmob REST API ~ v1](https://docs.graphmob.com/v1/) at reference revision: 07/24/2017
* **üòò Maintainer**: [@valeriansaliou](https://github.com/valeriansaliou)

## Usage

Install the library:

```bash
npm install graphmob-api --save
```

Then, import it:

```javascript
var Graphmob = require("graphmob-api").Graphmob;
```

Construct a new authenticated Graphmob client with your `user_id` and `secret_key` tokens (you can generate those from your Graphmob Dashboard, [see the docs](https://docs.graphmob.com/v1/)).

```javascript
var client = new Graphmob("ui_xxxxxx", "sk_xxxxxx");
```

Then, consume the client eg. to enrich an email address:

```javascript
api.Enrich.Email({
  email: "valerian@crisp.chat"
})
  .then(function(data) {
    console.info("Enriched email:", data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error("Failed enriching email:", error);
  });
```

_This library uses Promise for asynchronous response handling. If your NodeJS version is recent enough and has support for native promises, then the library will use native promises. Otherwise, it will fallback on a non-native implementation of promises._

## Authentication

To authenticate against the API, generate your tokens (`user_id` and `secret_key`) **once** from your [Graphmob Dashboard](https://dashboard.graphmob.com/).

Then, pass those tokens **once** when you instanciate the Graphmob client as following:

```javascript
// Make sure to replace 'user_id' and 'secret_key' with your tokens
var client = new Graphmob("user_id", "secret_key");
```

## Data Discovery

**When Graphmob doesn't know about a given data point, eg. an email that was never enriched before, it launches a discovery. Discoveries can take a few seconds, and sometimes more than 10 seconds.**

This library implements a retry logic with a timeout if the discovery takes too long, or if the item wasn't found.

Thus, you can expect some requests, especially the Enrich requests, to take more time than expected. This is normal, and is not a performance issue on your side, or on our side. Under the hood, when you request a data point (eg. enrich a person given an email) that doesn't yet exist in our databases, the Graphmob API returns the HTTP response `102 Processing`. Then, this library will poll the enrich resource for results, with intervals of a few seconds. The API will return `404 Not Found` as the discovery is still processing and no result is yet known at this point. Once a result is found, the API will reply with `200 OK` and discovered data. If the discovery fails and no data can be aggregated for this email, the library aborts the retry after some time (less than 20 seconds), and returns a `not_found` error.
